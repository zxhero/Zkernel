# Zkernel
A simple kernel based on MIPS ISA.  A File system based on FUSE 

In the Operating System experience course, I build three versions of Kernel named
Non-Preemptive-kernel, Preemptive-kernel, Synchronization-Primitives-IPC respectively.
They all base on the work done in Bootloader.

Besides, I build a File system which implies hash table in file operations. It support file
operations: mkdir rmdir readdir mknod symlink link unlink open release read write truncate getattr rename statfs init

You can find details of above works in ./<work_name>/Dseign Documents.
